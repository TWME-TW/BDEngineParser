/**
 * Provides internal utility and helper classes for the BD Engine Parser library.
 * <p>
 * Classes within this package are considered internal implementation details of the
 * {@code dev.twme.bdengineparser} library and are not intended for direct public use
 * by external applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The APIs of classes in this package are subject to change without notice in future
 * versions of the library, as they may be refactored or modified to support the
 * evolution of the public API. Client applications should rely only on the public
 * classes and interfaces provided in the {@code dev.twme.bdengineparser} package
 * and its sub-packages (excluding {@code internal} packages).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a class within this package is declared as {@code public}, it is typically for
 * technical reasons to allow access from other packages within this library (e.g.,
 * the main parser class needing to instantiate or call methods on these internal
 * helpers). However, this does not imply that they are part of the stable,
 * supported public API of the library.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 2.0
